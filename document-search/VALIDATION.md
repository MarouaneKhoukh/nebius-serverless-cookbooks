# Validation

## Current full-index flow

On November 13, 2026, three fresh preemptible Serverless Jobs exercised the new full-run default and optional 600/400 test in Mkhoukh. They executed published commit [`f1d8ca048018c924edef6b7cf21052b5c479974a`](https://github.com/MarouaneKhoukh/nebius-serverless-cookbooks/tree/f1d8ca048018c924edef6b7cf21052b5c479974a/document-search). The main and final resume submissions left `MAX_NEW_DOCUMENTS` unset; the launcher supplied its default `0`. Only the optional first attempt explicitly set `600`. [Effective launch settings](docs/job-results/default-flow/launch-settings.json).

| Attempt | New documents | Reused documents | Remaining | Saved chunks |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Main flow with default settings | 1,000 | 0 | 0 | 1,970 |
| Optional first attempt | 600 | 0 | 400 | 1,206 |
| Optional fresh Job | 400 | 600 | 0 | 1,970 |

The main Job printed `Finished: 1,000 new, 0 reused, 0 remaining.` and generated the search JSON and HTML in the same attempt. The optional test used a separate fresh prefix: one Job saved 600 documents, then a new default Job printed `600 documents already saved, 400 to go.` and finished the remaining 400. All reports match the same input/model fingerprint. This controlled application stop was not a provider preemption. [Main report](docs/job-results/default-flow/main.json), [first 600](docs/job-results/default-flow/limited-600.json), [remaining 400](docs/job-results/default-flow/resumed-400.json).

## Runtime and input

Each Job used one NVIDIA L40S, `pytorch/pytorch:2.7.1-cuda12.6-cudnn9-runtime`, PyTorch 2.7.1+cu126 and Transformers 4.51.3. The model was `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` at revision `97b0c614be4d77ee51c0cef4e5f07c00f9eb65b3`, with normalized 1,024-dimensional float16 vectors, last-token pooling, a maximum batch size of 16 within each document, and paragraph-aware 160-word chunks.

The pinned input contains 1,000 distinct Dolly reference passages and produces 1,970 chunks. Its text volume and provenance are recorded in the unchanged [corpus manifest record](docs/job-results/corpus.json); the worker validates the pinned data before indexing.

## New measured phases

Seconds measured inside these new containers, rounded to two decimal places:

| Phase | Main 1,000 | Optional 600 | Resume 400 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Source and dependency setup | 11.40 | 10.24 | 10.11 |
| Pinned data preparation | 0.86 | 1.75 | 0.80 |
| Model startup | 38.20 | 36.58 | 37.55 |
| Embedding | 21.16 | 12.46 | 8.38 |
| Saving results | 10.12 | 6.01 | 3.92 |
| State scan | 0.04 | 0.04 | 4.87 |
| Index application total | 69.92 | 55.37 | 55.00 |

The index application total includes model startup, embedding, saving, scanning and small application overheads. It excludes dependency setup, input preparation, later search and report uploads. Provisioning/image-pull time is recorded separately as coarse status observations, which include polling delay and can include work already performed. [Lifecycle observations](docs/job-results/default-flow/lifecycle.json). These measurements are not runtime promises.

## Search

The main Job used the default query, “What is stalemate in chess?” The relevant stalemate passage ranked first, similarity 0.8240; the next result scored 0.5424. Results link to the pinned source dataset records. [Search JSON](docs/job-results/default-flow/search.json), [HTML report](docs/job-results/default-flow/search.html). This is an executed example, not a retrieval benchmark.

## Local checks and execution scope

68 local tests passed with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`. They cover full-run/search defaults, explicit-limit forwarding by both launchers, resume and mid-document crash recovery with fixture embeddings, changed-setting refusal, and safe S3 errors. Local fixtures and mocked bootstrap checks are separate from the live runs above.

The existing live crash records and earlier capped-default measurements remain in [historical results](docs/job-results/live/); they were not rerun for this framing/default change and do not supply any timings in the new table. The worker recovery design is unchanged. The three live Jobs used a published PR revision; a clean-`main` walkthrough after merge remains a separate release check.

## Cleanup

All three test Jobs completed and their managed compute was removed. The temporary SecretStash copy was deleted; the pre-existing S3 access key and bucket were preserved. New index and search artifacts remain in Object Storage. [Cleanup record](docs/job-results/default-flow/cleanup.json).
